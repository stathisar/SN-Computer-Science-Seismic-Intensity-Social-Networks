Current repository presents an automatic approach of developing seismic intensity maps through social networks. 
The scripts include information regarding training an LSTM-RNN model along with georeferencing and creating seismic intensity prediction rasters through simple kriging. It is part of a research presented in SN Computer Science Journal.

Main libraries involve mxnet (version 1.8, R package) and gstat.

Sample data, are included.
